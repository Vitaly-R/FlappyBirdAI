# FlappyBirdAI

How to run:
* In order to play the game, run the file HumanPlayerMain.py
* In order to train an AI to play the game, run TrainingMain.py. 
The training parameters - which are the number of 
players in each generation, the max number of training generations, and the mutation rate - 
can be changed in that file.
* In order to load a saved AI player, fill in the path of the saved weights file in the 'path' variable in the
LoadAIPlayer.py file. If a non-existing path, or no path at all, is filled in, the player will be untrained.
